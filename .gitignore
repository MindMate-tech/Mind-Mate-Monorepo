# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if have platform-specific dependencies, which can result in locking conflicts.
#   A good practice is to generate Pipfile.lock from Pipfile during CI/CD process.
#   Hence Pipfile.lock may be ignored.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to commit poetry.lock to keep the dependencies consistent.
#   However, in some cases it may be desirable to ignore them.
